        <h2><strong>Discover Traditional Ju Jutsu in Perth</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the ancient Japanese art of self-defence, Ju Jutsu, often searched as <strong>Jiu Jitsu</strong>, right here in Perth, Western Australia at Jan de Jong Martial Arts & Fitness. Please note that while our martial art shares some similarities with what is commonly known as "Jiu Jitsu", we teach traditional Ju Jutsu, not Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). Ju Jutsu was used by the Samurai in feudal Japan and is a comprehensive system of self-defence that can be applied against armed or unarmed assailants. The range of techniques is vast, and the combinations and variations are endless.

        <h2><strong>The Origins of Ju Jutsu and Its Connection to Jiu Jitsu</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Ju Jutsu formed the basis for <a href="/aikido-perth">Aikido</a>, Judo and some styles of Karate. Because of its efficiency and effectiveness, Ju Jutsu has proved to be equally applicable for the modern warriors of the S.A.S. as well as for women and children. The style of Ju Jutsu taught at our Dojo is based on Tsutsumi Hozan Ryu Ju Jutsu, whose origins can be traced back to 14th century Japan. While it's often searched as "Jiu Jitsu" online, our focus is on the traditional Japanese martial art of Ju Jutsu.
