        <h2>Women's Self Defence & Personal Safety Courses</h2>
        <p>
          "Self defence is a basic life skill which most women will find useful at least once in their life time."
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be taught a number of self defence techniques that can be easily learnt and used against a wide variety of attacks. These techniques are based on Ju Jutsu techniques and emphasise efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means you don't have to be strong, big, athletic, flexible or aggressive to be effective. A part of the course also covers ways of avoiding and/or diffusing potentially dangerous situations, and to provide alternatives to physical contact/fighting. Development of healthy self confidence and self image will make you less likely to be a target. These and other proactive attributes are integral to the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with other life skills such as water and road safety, first aid and so on, your knowledge of self defence may one day also ensure the safety of your family, friends and other members of the community. Everybody has a basic right to feel free to do what they want, within certain boundaries, without feeling constrained by the fear of violence. Learning self defence and taking sensible precautions enables you to more freely exercise that right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes are run in an easy, friendly and relaxed atmosphere with time for participants to discuss individual issues with the instructor at the end of class. Everyone works to their own capabilities and there is never any expectation that you should do anything you do not feel comfortable with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you wish to consult with the instructor before enrolling for a course you only have to call or email us to make an appointment.
