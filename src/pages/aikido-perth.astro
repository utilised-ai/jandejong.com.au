        <h2>Discover Aikido, a Modern Japanese Martial Art in Perth</h2>
        <p>
          Immerse yourself in the 'way of harmony' with Aikido, a modern Japanese martial art, right here in Perth, Western Australia at Jan de Jong Martial Arts & Fitness. Aikido, an unarmed method of self-defence, was established in Japan in 1942 by Morihei Ueshiba. It's founded on the principles of harmony and non-resistance, allowing you to take control of an attacker's force or momentum, rather than stopping it.

        <h2>The Power of 'Ki' in Aikido</h2>
        <p>
          This martial art doesn't rely on physical strength, but on balance, leverage, skill, and the application of 'ki' or life force. The term 'ki' is often used by martial artists and is the Japanese equivalent of 'Chi' in China or 'Prana' in India. In Western cultures, we might refer to it as 'focused mental thought' or an extension of our thought process. It's present in all things and is also referred to as 'life force'. When understood, this concept explains why you don't need to be physically stronger than your opponent to master Aikido.

        <h2>Aikido Classes in Perth</h2>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Aikido classes in Perth</strong> combine practical self-defence movements derived from <a href="/ju-jutsu">Ju Jutsu</a>, spear and <a href="/sword-training">sword fighting</a>, Aikijutsu, and other martial arts forms. The emphasis is on harmonising with the attacker's force. Aikido has gained immense popularity due to its highly ethical and moral nature, as it is fundamentally a non-violent self-defence system.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Effectiveness of Aikido</h2>
        <p>
          While Aikido is often considered a softer martial art and the gentlemen's fighting art, it is undeniably an effective form of self-defence. Jan de Jong studied Yoseikan Aikido in Japan under Mochizuki Sensei, a direct student of Aikido's founder, Morihei Ueshiba.
