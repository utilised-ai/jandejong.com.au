        <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          "Since my first introduction to the art of Ju Jutsu, close to 70 years ago,
        </p>
        <p>
          it has always fascinated me. Although it is a fighting art, the greater the knowledge one gains, the more relevance one can see it has to another art
        </p>
        <p>
          – the art of living."
        </p>
        <h4>Jan de Jong OAM</h4>
        
        <p>Letter from the desk of Jan de Jong Shihan, 1997:</p>
        
        <p>
          In Ju Jutsu one learns the science of unbalancing, leverage, utilisation of ki(or mental control of physical force), the art of rolling and break falling without damage to one's body, the controlling and subduing of an attacker and other logical, well thought out methods of using one's body to avoid attack or harm. In other words, turning an unfavourable situation in which we find ourselves into a position of advantage. Is it not so in daily life? Instead of the mental stress of worrying about the misfortune of a potentially damaging or negative situation, to be able to focus one's mental and physical powers on ways to change the position to one of advantage. So I have found that Ju Jutsu is in essence an application of the precept 'accept and survive'.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Looking back at my own early years in Australia (1952-1963), self defence was often considered a rather peculiar and odd thing to do. The term "judo" was known by some, but most people had not even heard of "karate" or "kung fu", let alone "Ju Jutsu." My expressed intention to make the teaching of this art into my living was almost always met with doubt, if not ridicule. The idea that anyone could teach an oriental self defence professionally was not considered possible. However, I had the confidence that I could and would do this. When I did make it my full-time occupation in 1963, to the best of my knowledge I was the only full-time martial arts instructor in Australia. Nowadays of course, martial arts is a normal activity and many of us can make it into our living, but I still recall the early years and would encourage younger people to: "believe in yourself, work hard, focus on your goal and don't give up".

        <h2>Jan de Jong's Self Defence School</h2>
        <p>
          Often the ties formed with Jan de Jong and his School are very strong and longlasting. Many people who have experienced Jan de Jong's martial arts encourage their children and grandchildren to do likewise. Some current students in Perth represent the third generation of families involved with the School. Whilst giving a seminar in Holland in 1994, Jan de Jong was approached by two gentlemen. He immediately recognised them as former students from his Rotterdam School. They confirmed this by proudly presenting their original membership cards which they had kept for over 50 years. Two years later he was again approached by two former members, one of whom was Piet Hesselink. They had lost contact when Jan de Jong emigrated to Indonesia in 1946. Piet Hesselink is still teaching Ju Jutsu in Holland.

        <h3>1955</h3>

Jan de Jong demonstrated a bridgefall and put both his feet through the floorboards into the river. The next lesson he had three students. One of these students suggested that using mats may encourage more people to take up Ju Jutsu, so they made some mats by hand as they couldn't be purchased at that time. The School was named "Ju Jutsu Kan Perth."</p>
        
        <h3>1960</h3>
        <p>School relocated to 870 Hay Street, Perth – the first known full-time martial arts School in Australia.</p>

        <p>Classes in Aikido and Pencak Silat were offered to the public for the first time. Phillipe Boiron, trained by Minoru Mochizuki, taught aikido. Jan de Jong had been teaching Pencak Silat to higher graded Ju Jutsu students since 1955.</p>
        
        <h3>1975</h3>
